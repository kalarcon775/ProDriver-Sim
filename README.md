# ProDriver-Sim
ProDriver Sim was developed by an intern at LUX Dynamics to speed up LED fixture testing and reduce iteration time between simulation and bench validation. It models real LED drivers and boards using measured curves, grid variability, and loss mechanisms to quickly predict system behavior.
